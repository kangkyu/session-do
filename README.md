## README

> you have said "I'll do it tomorrow" on the task for a while. but since when?

* user edit feature - would better be validated by password
* on tasks list - move a task up and down
* send email for password reset (add 'forgot password?' feature)
* view sample page (or instruction) first time gets here - currently to register page. not good.
