## session-do

> You have said "I'll do it every now and then" on your tasks. But do you remember when? You might ask "When was the last time I've done it" for each ongoing task (or "session"). You might say "I have done this a while ago", but how long ago?

This tool is for people who want to keep the momentum about many things to do.
